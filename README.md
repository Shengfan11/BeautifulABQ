# ViridisABQ
This snippet adds the fabulous Viridis colormap from matplotlib to Simulia Abaqus/CAE.

Copy `abaqus_v6.env` into your home directory or any other directory where Abaqus searches for environment files.
Have a look at Abaqus Installation and Licensing Guide, chapter 4.1 to see where these directories might be. You can reach the guide from *Abaqus -> Help -> Search & Browse Guides... -> Abaqus Installation and Licensing Guide*.

If you already have an `abaqus_v6.env` file or even use an `onCaeStartup()` routine, simply copy the contents from this repository to the appropriate place.

Abaqus will load the instructions at start-up and automatically use Viridis in the Visualization module.

For some background information on Viridis please have a look at: [mpl colormaps](https://bids.github.io/colormap/)
